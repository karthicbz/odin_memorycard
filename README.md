# Odin memory card project

In this project i have use react hooks `useEffect` and `useState`

The `useEffect` hook looks easy but it is really difficult to implement. I have use two `useEffect` in this project one is to fetch the Harry potter characters images and names and other one to change the new set of characters for next play.

you can run this project in your machine by cloning the repo and you need to install required `npm` modules by typing `npm install` in your console.

Happy Hacking!
